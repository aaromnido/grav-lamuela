<p><img src="assets/readme_1.png" alt="Problems"></p>
<p><code>Problems</code> is a <a href="http://github.com/getgrav/grav">Grav</a> Plugin and allows to detect issues.</p>
<p>This plugin is included in any package distributed that contains Grav. If you decide to clone Grav from GitHub, you will most likely want to install this.</p>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>Installing the Problems plugin can be done in one of two ways. Our GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the plugin with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file.</p>
<h2 id="gpm-installation-preferred-">GPM Installation (Preferred)</h2>
<p>The simplest way to install this plugin is via the <a href="http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm">Grav Package Manager (GPM)</a> through your system&#39;s Terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:</p>
<pre><code>bin/gpm install problems
</code></pre><p>This will install the Problems plugin into your <code>/user/plugins</code> directory within Grav. Its files can be found under <code>/your/site/grav/user/plugins/problems</code>.</p>
<h2 id="manual-installation">Manual Installation</h2>
<p>To install this plugin, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under <code>/your/site/grav/user/plugins</code>. Then, rename the folder to <code>problems</code>. You can find these files either on <a href="https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-problems">GitHub</a> or via <a href="http://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins#extras">GetGrav.org</a>.</p>
<p>You should now have all the plugin files under</p>
<pre><code>/your/site/grav/user/plugins/problems
</code></pre><blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: This plugin is a modular component for Grav which requires <a href="http://github.com/getgrav/grav">Grav</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-error">Error</a> and <a href="https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-problems">Problems</a> plugins, and a theme to be installed in order to operate.</p>

<p>If an issue is discovered, you will be greeted with a page that lists these checks and whether or not your install passed or failed them. Green checks mean it passed, and a red x indicates that the there is something amiss with the item.</p>
<p>Problems uses the cache as refresh indicator. That means that if nothing has changed anywhere, the plugin will just skip its validation tests altogether.</p>
<p>If a change is caught and the cache is refreshed, the plugin will loop through its validation tests and making sure nothing is out of place.</p>
<p><code>Problems</code> gets also triggered if any fatal exception is caught.</p>
<h1 id="updating">Updating</h1>
<p>As development for the Problems plugin continues, new versions may become available that add additional features and functionality, improve compatibility with newer Grav releases, and generally provide a better user experience. Updating Problems is easy, and can be done through Grav&#39;s GPM system, as well as manually.</p>
<h2 id="gpm-update-preferred-">GPM Update (Preferred)</h2>
<p>The simplest way to update this plugin is via the <a href="http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm">Grav Package Manager (GPM)</a>. You can do this with this by navigating to the root directory of your Grav install using your system&#39;s Terminal (also called command line) and typing the following:</p>
<pre><code>bin/gpm update problems
</code></pre><p>This command will check your Grav install to see if your Problems plugin is due for an update. If a newer release is found, you will be asked whether or not you wish to update. To continue, type <code>y</code> and hit enter. The plugin will automatically update and clear Grav&#39;s cache.</p>
<h2 id="manual-update">Manual Update</h2>
<p>Manually updating Problems is pretty simple. Here is what you will need to do to get this done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete the <code>your/site/user/plugins/problems</code> directory.</li>
<li>Download the new version of the Problems plugin from either <a href="https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-problems">GitHub</a> or <a href="http://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins#extras">GetGrav.org</a>.</li>
<li>Unzip the zip file in <code>your/site/user/plugins</code> and rename the resulting folder to <code>problems</code>.</li>
<li>Clear the Grav cache. The simplest way to do this is by going to the root Grav directory in terminal and typing <code>bin/grav clear-cache</code>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Any changes you have made to any of the files listed under this directory will also be removed and replaced by the new set. Any files located elsewhere (for example a YAML settings file placed in <code>user/config/plugins</code>) will remain intact.</p>
