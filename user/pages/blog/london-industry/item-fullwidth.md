**Beatae inventore eius odit?**

With the recent exit of the Mac App Store we think that we can push updates faster. I’m really excited to be able to ship the things that we have planned for the new year. I think we learned that the last big update took too long and now we want to keep shipping smaller updates. But I don’t want to say too much, because we all know how that works with software!

_It was interesting and engaging hearing Pieter’s thoughts and hopes for Sketch and where it resides in the space. He remains pleased with the size, scale and rate of growth at which Sketch is progressing. I’m now personally looking forward to more to come from Pieter and his team. While I don’t think Comet is going to be an overnight success that kills Sketch off, I do think it may take a bite out of Pieter’s lunch. One thing I did come away with, is that Pieter is dedicated and passionate about Sketch and that regardless of what competitors do, he’s not going anywhere for a long time._

**Presentations**

The last item on the agenda was for each designer to present their wireframes to the entire group along with their user test results. We wanted to give everyone the chance to see the wide array of wireframes that were designed by the team. Avery Smith presented first, then Tommy Hung, myself, Justin Haldane, and Paul Hershey respectively.
